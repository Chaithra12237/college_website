                   <p><h4>Janab A. Thangal Kunju Musaliar (1897-1966)</h4></p>

                    <p>“When the mind begins to experience the sensation of physical comfort, joy or satisfied desires; the intelligence has to act as a judge with consciousness as mediator”- Janab Thangal Kunju Musaliar.</p>
                    
                   <p> Janab Thangal Kunju Musaliar,  is a magnanimous name that rings loud in the educational, economic and socio-cultural development of the city of Kollam. An ace entrepreneur and a great visionary, he set his own life as an example of sheer determination, hard work, courage and leadership.</p>
                    
                    <p>Born on 12th January 1897, in a middle class family that traces its ancestry to Malik ibn Deenar, a legendary Islamic missionary who came to India in the 8th century and in a later generation to Sheikh Ali Hassan Musaliar, entombed in the Sheikh Masjid at Karunagapally. He belongs to the 12th generation after him.</p>
                    
                    <p>The cashew industry of Kerala was at its threshold in the 1940s and 50s, when Thangal Kunju Musaliar donned the cashew trade and was quite popular as the ‘Cashew King’ in national and international markets. He was a pioneer in this field to build a vast empire through impeccable planning and systematic implementation and played a pivotal role in contributing the much needed foreign exchange to the state. In 1940, a U.S. magazine, ‘Fortune’ described him as the world’s largest employer.</p>
